Semantic Book Recommender
A machine learning-powered system that recommends books based on semantic understanding of reader preferences and book content.

Overview:
The Semantic Book Recommender uses natural language processing and deep learning techniques to understand the thematic elements,
writing style, and content of books. Unlike traditional recommendation systems that rely solely on user ratings or purchase history, 
this system analyzes the actual content of books to make more nuanced recommendations.

Features:
Semantic Text Analysis: Processes book descriptions, reviews, and sample content to understand themes and writing styles
Personalized Recommendations: Learns user preferences based on reading history and explicit feedback
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends books with similar content characteristics rather than just popularity metrics
Cross-Genre Discovery: Identifies thematic similarities between books across different genres.
